PCSX2 - Playstation 2

The directory '~/retrodeck/texture_packs/PCSX2/' corresponds to the '/PCSX2/textures/' folder in PCSX2.

Please note that some texture packs may be designed for a specific version or region of a game. Ensure you have the correct game and textures for it.

Also, keep in mind that 'TITLEID' is different for every game.

To enable Custom Textures, follow these steps:

1. Open up PCSX2 inside RetroDECK Configurator by pressing 'Open Emulator' - 'PCSX2'.
2. Press 'Settings' -> 'Graphics'.
3. Set 'Load Textures' and 'Async Texture Loading' to On.

To add texture packs, you'll need the texture pack files. On the Steam Deck, this could be easier to do in Desktop Mode.

For direct texture folder:

1. Extract any texture pack files from compressed .zip or any other format into folders.
2. Go into '~/retrodeck/texture_packs/PCSX2/'. The folders are all named by 'TITLEID'.
3. Move textures into the correct '~/retrodeck/texture_packs/PCSX2/<TITLEID>' folder.

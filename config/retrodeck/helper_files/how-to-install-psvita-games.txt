# Guide: Vita3K

Please note that the PSVita support is still experimental and it will be available starting from RetroDECK 0.8.0b, and for the way Vita3K is actually working the automation is limited.
In order to install a PSVita games is needed to:

- Install a game opening the Vita3K emulator via Configurator, the supported formats are `pkg`, `zip`, `vpk`.
- Upon installation the `zRIF` may be asked, it's different for each game, you can find it via web search by searching for example `WipEout 2048 (EU) zRIF`.
- Install DLCs and patches in the same way.
- Create an empty file in `retrodeck/roms/psvita/gamename.psvita`, please mind the `.psvita` extension.<br>
For example: `roms/psvita/WipEout 2048 (EU).psvita.`
- Edit the empty file adding the game `Title ID` (more below).
- The game should appear in the game list after RetroDECK is re-opened or reloaded from the Utilities.

## How to find a title ID
It can be found inside the Vita3K GUI in the Title ID column, or found via web search.
For example the game `WipEout 2048 (EU)` has an ID that is `PCSF00007`.
So simply add `PCSF00007` to the `WipEout 2048 (EU).psvita` file and the setup for this game is complete.

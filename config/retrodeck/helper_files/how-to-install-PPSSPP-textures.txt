PPSSPP - PSP

The directory '~/retrodeck/texture_packs/ppsspp/' corresponds to the '/PSP/TEXTURES/' folder in PPSSPP.

Please note that some texture packs may be designed for a specific version or region of the game. Ensure you have the correct ROM and textures for it.

Also, keep in mind that 'TITLEID' is different for every game.

To enable Custom Textures, follow these steps:

1. Open up PPSSPP inside RetroDECK Configurator by pressing 'Open Emulator' - 'PPSSPP'.
2. Press 'Settings' -> 'Tools' -> 'Developer Tools'.
3. Set 'Replace Textures' to On.

To add texture packs, you'll need the texture pack files. On the Steam Deck, this could be easier to do in Desktop Mode.

For adding textures:

1. Extract any texture pack files from compressed .zip or any other format into folders.
2. Go into '~/retrodeck/texture_packs/ppsspp/'. The folders are all named by 'TITLEID'.
3. Paste the textures into the correct '~/retrodeck/texture_packs/ppsspp/<TITLEID>' folder.

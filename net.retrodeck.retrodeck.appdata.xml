      <p>What is Retrodeck?</p>
      <p>RetroDECK is an emulation and retro gaming solution to catalog and play your game collection directly from Linux in one unified application.
  It's inspired by other embedded emulation systems like AmberELEC, EmuELEC, CoreELEC, Lakka, and Batocera.
  RetroDECK is powered by EmulationStation Desktop Edition, that uses RetroArch and other standalone emulators to allow you to import and play your favorite games in a tidy environment.
  No other software is needed as everything it's already included in one package!</p>
      <p>BETA NOTICE: RetroDECK is still in Beta and the team is actively developing and adding more features.
         The primary focus during the beta period is on SteamOS and the Steam Deck but we hope to expand to more devices and general Linux desktop in the future</p>
      <p>NOTE: It can be run on Linux desktop right now but there will be some manual configurations needed for input, storage location and other tiny hickups.</p>
      <p>
         INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE STEAM DECK:
            1. Start RetroDECK from the Desktop mode (only needed for the initial first time configuration)
            2. Add RetroDECK to your Steam Library by pressing "Add a non-steam game to my library"
            3. Download the offical RetroDECK controller profile from Steam
            4. [OPTIONAL] Download Steam Grids graphics for RetroDECK with BoilR
      </p>

         <description>
            <p>Updates:</p>

            <p>Known issues:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>PPSSPP now have Retroachievements, but it is right now not configurable in the configurator (as it works a bit different the other emulators), we hope to have a solution for it at a later date. You can still login / logout / enable hardcore mode normally from the PPSSPP interface.</li>
               <li>Quitting the RetroArch GB core with the radial function makes the core swap the palette.</li>
               <li>Borders sometimes are disappearing, a possible workaround is to reset RetroArch from the configurator.</li>

         <description>
            <ul>
               <li>Persistent configurations when updating RetroDECK, this means your custom configurations should be saved across future versions. (We also laid groundwork for dynamic persistent configurations, more on that in a future update. This is the reason why it has taken quite long to fix this).</li>
               <li>Added Primehack controller profiles for both Xbox and Nintendo button layouts</li>
               <li>Added a warning when running RetroDECK in desktop mode, as not all controls will work properly.</li>

               <li>Reworked CLI commands and added safety y/n confirmations for the reset arguments.</li>

               <li>Fixed Duckstation initial configuration as it was broken (will require user-performed reset just this once)</li>
               <li>Fixed Pico-8 initial configuration as it was broken.</li>
               <li>Fixed Pico-8 dual bios folders. The program files pico8_dyn,pico8.dat and pico8 have to be manually moved to the correct location~/retrodeck/bios/pico-8/. The old ~/retrodeck/bios/pico8/ is renamed ~/retrodeck/bios/pico8_olddata/ to avoid confusion on where to put files. After the files have moved the pico8_olddata folder can be deleted.</li>
               <li>Fixed a bug that made the Dolphin RetroArch core not working properly (the standalone version of Dolphin always worked and is the default)</li>

            <ul>
               <li>Fixed a bug where new symlinks were not created correctly and users couldn't scrape their games</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Known Issues:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>PCSX2: due to its limitation, the standalone PCSX2 doesn't have any way to set the hotkeys, so no save and load state, no quit button. In order to quit press: STEAM -&gt; PCSX2 -&gt; (X) CLOSE WINDOW, be aware that the state is not automatically saved</li>
               <li>Due to a Steam limitation, external controllers and keyboard seems not to be working, expecially in the desktop mode</li>
            </ul>
            IMPORTANT NOTE:
        At the moment the emulator configs are reset during every update, this was made because every version they may bring new configurations, please back them up if you did some manual configs.

# Themes general information

## How to switch between themes?
Go into `Main Menu` - `UI Settings` - `Theme Set` to select the theme you want to use.

## ES-DE Theme List
Look over at the [Theme List](https://gitlab.com/es-de/themes/themes-list) and find themes you like.

## How do I add additional themes?

RetroDECK uses [ES-DE](https://www.es-de.org) for its interface so any theme that is compatible with ES-DE can also be used with RetroDECK

### From the Theme Downloader

Go into `Main Menu` - `UI Settings` - `Theme Downloader` from there you can download a wide array of themes.

### From the Internet
If you find a theme you would like to use that is not in the `Theme Downloader` please download it and place it in `~/retrodeck/themes` (make sure the theme has its own folder in that directory).

**Description:** <br>
Art Book Next is a theme that tries to emulate the feeling of flipping trough your game library as if they where pages of a coffee table book.

# Any other recommended software?

The following software works great with the Steam Deck and might enhance your RetroDECK experience (these are entirely optional to install). 

There is a guide on how to install several of them under [Steam Deck: Optimizations](https://github.com/XargonWan/RetroDECK/wiki/Steam-Deck%3A-Optimizations). 

# Steam Deck specific recommendations

## Decky Loader
Is a great piece of software that allows custom plugins inside Steam Deck's gamemode. It can open up more advanced features then the standard Steam Deck experience offers. But it's a bit more technical to install, please follow the guide on their github.

## PowerTools 
If you install the Decky Plugin Loader above you can download the PowerTools application from the plugin store that let's you do advanced tweaking of the Steam Decks hardware. This can greatly improve performance on certain games in the PS2,GC and above generations. But it requires you to find the knowledge of what setting works best for each game and/or emulator.

## Discover Overlay 
If you use Discord this is a program that adds Discord integration into the Steam Deck's gamemode UI.
It's already in on flathub and downloadable in Discover. Note that you need to install and login to Discord as well.

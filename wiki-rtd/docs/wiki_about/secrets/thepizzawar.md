# The Pizza War

Who will prevail?

## The Italian Pizza Legion - IPL
Conservative purists of pure Italian Pizza Force.

*"Pizza is Italian and everything else is a facsimile, a mockery of Italian perfection. Our mothers and fathers gave everything for the purity of the Napoletana and so shall you!"*.

## The Murican Cheese Crust Patriots - MCCP
Patriotic Americans that try to crush the opposition with infinite pepperoni and cheese.

*"The Italian American imigrants took Pizza to the US and made it better thanks to freedom. Are we not free to put as much pepperoni as we want? How about Mozzarella or bread sticks is there a upper limit? We say no there is not! The symbol of new found freedom of the Italian Americans is not the cheese filled crusts? All of these inovations where made thanks to being free."*.

## The Nordic Pizza Cult - NPC
Label as Heretics by the others for their dark pizza magicks.

*"The Italians and Americans are weak, the don't dare to take Pizza beyond their set fake borders and rules. Here in the cold north we have learned and now know the truth... there is no borders. Pizza is an empty canvas, it can be painted in to what ever chaotic image of food perfection we desire!"*.

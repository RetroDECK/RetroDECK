# Information on donations
RetroDECK is nothing without our dependencies without them this project and many others like us cannot exist. If you do not want to donate to RetroDECK and you might want to donate to the ES-DE front-end, art assets or a specific emulator. We support you no matter what, whatever choice you take from this list will be a good one for us all.

**Please note:**

We are trying to list current and future software we want to include in RetroDECK. More things will be added all the time. There are even more emulators, software, front-ends, and assets out there that are not part of the RetroDECK project for various other systems. This is not a complete list of all Emulators or Frontends for the entire internet.

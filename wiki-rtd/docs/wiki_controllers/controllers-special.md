# Special Controllers

Special Controllers is a broad category that encompasses the vast majority of third and first party controllers that don't fit anywhere else. <br>
They might have been made for a single game.

### How to use with RetroDECK or a PC or anything else?

There have been efforts by user SantiagoSaldana of hackaday.io to get it working on PCs via a Teensy 3.6 / 4.1 Arduino Adapter.

It translates the controllers input to emulated xinput. You can read more about the project here:

[Hackady.io Project Thread](https://hackaday.io/project/182810-steel-battalion-controller-teensy-adapter)

[Github Steel Battalion Controller Library for Arduino](https://github.com/SantiagoSaldana/SBC)

If you have this rare controller and want to try to get it running by the above methods on Linux and RetroDECK please contact the RetroDECK team on discord to inform on your efforts we will follow them with great intrest.

# Texture Packs: Dolphin / Primehack - GC & Wii
Primehack is based on Dolphin so the method is the same.

The `~/retrodeck/texture_packs/dolphin/` & `~/retrodeck/texture_packs/primehack/` represents the `/load/Textures` folder.<br>

**Note:** <br>
Some texture packs could made for a specific version or region of a game. Make sure you have the right game and textures for it.

**Note:**<br>
`GAME_ID` is different for every game.

## Enable Custom Textures
* Open up Dolphin or Primehack inside `RetroDECK Configurator` by pressing `Open Emulator` - `Dolphin` or `Primehack`.
* Press `Options` -> `Graphic Settings`

`Load Custom Textures` and set it to `On`.<br>

`Prefetch Custom Textures` and set it to `On`.

## How do I add texture packs?

**Requirements:** Texture pack files <br>

**NOTE:** On the Steam Deck this could be easier to do in `Desktop Mode`.


### Directly in the folder

1. Extract any texture pack files from compressed `.zip` or any other format into folders.

2. Go into texture pack folders, they contain folders that are all named by `GAME_ID`.<br>
**Dolphin:**`~/retrodeck/texture_packs/dolphin/` <br>
**Primehack:**`~/retrodeck/texture_packs/primehack/`.

3. Move the textures into the right folder: <br>
**Dolphin:** `~/retrodeck/texture_packs/dolphin/<GAME_ID>` <br>
**Primehack:** `~/retrodeck/texture_packs/primehack/<GAME_ID>` <br>

# RetroDECK 0.7.2b

**Release Date: 28/09/2023**

## Updates:
The following features have been updated

- All standalone emulators
- EmulationStation Desktop Edition (ES-DE)
- RetroArch and cores
- The included ES-DE themes

## Bugfixes & other changes:
- Added helper .txt files to the mod & texture pack folders.
- The builtin changelog is now scrollable.
- The loading bar color is after much debate once again red.
- Gameboy Advanced & Game Gear integer scaling changes based on feedback.
- Optimized and retooled the patching process for ES-DE.
- Various fixes and optimizations to the RetroDECK build process.

## Known issues
- PPSSPP: Retroachievements is in the latest version, you can login / logout / enable hardcore mode normally from the emulators interface. It is right now not configurable in the Configurator (as it works a bit different the other emulators), we hope to have a solution for it at a later date.
- RetroArch: Quitting the Gambatte core with the `Quit` radial function makes the core swap the palette while playing GB.
- RetroArch: Borders are in some cases disappearing in the latest RetroArch version. A possible workaround is to reset RetroArch from the Configurator.

## New Features

- `RetroArch:` If no stable core exist within a stable release version of RetroArch a nightly version of the core will be used instead.
- Added the first RetroDECK `Easter Egg Boot Logo` for the Holiday period made by friend of the project, artist and author `Weestuarty`.

## Updates

- All standalone emulators
- RetroArch and cores

## Bugfixes & other changes

- Fixed a SD Card pathing error that could occur on very creative SD Card naming on SteamOS 3.5.
- `RetroArch:` The SCUMMVM Core was missing from the last RetroArch stable version and should have returned.
- `RetroArch:` Borders/Overlays are now disabled by default on fresh installs, since some users where worried about Steam Deck OLED screen burn-in. You can enable or disable them from the Configurator as always.
- `RPCS3:` Tweaked some configurations to slightly improve the performance on the Steam Deck LCD / OLED
- `Dolphin:` Fixed the GameCube controller layout that made some buttons inverted: R1 is now Z, R2 is now R and L2 is L.
- `CEMU:` Tweaked the audio configuration to choose the correct output device when docked.

🎆🤶 In addition the RetroDECK Team wishes you happy holidays and a happy new year! 🎅🎇

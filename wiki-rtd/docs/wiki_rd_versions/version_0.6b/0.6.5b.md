# RetroDECK v0.6.5b

**Release Date: 2023-04-07**

### Information:
Just a quick hotfix for Yuzu (since some games where not working in 0.6.4b).
So we had to roll back to the latest working version.
Newer versions will be shipped with v0.7b

## Bug fixes and other changes:
- Rolled back to latest working Yuzu as some games had issues with the latest update.
- Slightly improved Yuzu performance by tweaking GPU options
- Fixed an issue where the default theme was not loaded
- Removed unavailable emulators entries

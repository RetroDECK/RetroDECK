**Please note that we are going to rebuild the Configurator into a controller friendly GODOT application and that the current version is not the final design.**

The `RetroDECK Configurator` is a unique multi-use utility that exists within RetroDECK to manage many aspects of the application and exposes functions from the `RetroDECK Framework` to the user.

The `RetroDECK Configurator` can be opened from:

- The main menu inside the ES-DE interface and choose `RetroDECK Configurator`.

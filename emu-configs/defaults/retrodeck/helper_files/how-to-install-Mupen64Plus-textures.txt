RetroArch - N64 - Mupen64Plus-Next

The directory 'texture_packs/RetroArch-Mupen64Plus/' corresponds to the '/retroarch/system/Mupen64plus/' folder.

Please note that some texture packs may be designed for a specific version or region of the game. Ensure you have the correct ROM and textures for it.

To enable Texture Packs in the Mupen64Plus-Next core for certain games, follow these steps:

1. Open the RetroArch Quick Menu.
2. Navigate to Core Options -> GLideN64.
3. Set 'Use High-Res Textures', 'Cache Textures', 'Use High-Res Full Alpha Channel', and 'Use Hi-Res Storage' to On.
4. Save the current configuration for that game under Core Options -> Manage Core Options -> Save Game Options.

Optionally, you can set 'Use High-Res Texture Cache Compression' to On to compress uncompressed HD Textures into .hts files.

To add texture packs that can be used by the Mupen64Plus-Next Core:

Note: On the Steam Deck, this could be easier to do in Desktop Mode.

1. All texture packs go into the 'texture_packs//RetroArch-Mupen64Plus/hires_texture/' or 'texture_packs/RetroArch-Mupen64Plus/cache/' folder.
2. The texture pack must be extracted from .zip or other compressed format into a folder.

For compressed textures stored in .hts files, place them in the 'texture_packs/RetroArch-Mupen64Plus/cache/' folder.

For uncompressed textures stored in loose folders or files, place them in the 'texture_packs/RetroArch-Mupen64Plus/hires_texture/' folder.

TITLEID is different for every game.

How do I add texture packs?
Requirements: Texture pack files

NOTE: On the Steam Deck this could be easier to do in Desktop Mode.

Texture folder directly
- Extract any texture pack files from compressed .zip or any other format into folders.
- Go into ~/retrodeck/texture_packs/duckstation/. The folders are all named by TITLEID.
- Move textures into the right ~/retrodeck/texture_packs/duckstation/<TITLEID> folder.

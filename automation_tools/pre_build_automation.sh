# For the file paths to work correctly, call this script with this command from the cloned repo folder root:
# sh automation_tools/pre_build_automation.sh
# Different actions need different information in the task list file
# branch: This changes the placeholder text to the currently-detected GIT branch if an automated build was started from a PR environment.
# hash: Finds the SHA256 hash of a file online and updates the placeholder in the manifest. 
#     Needs the URL of the file, in this line format: hash^PLACEHOLDERTEXT^url
# latestcommit: Finds the most recent commit of a git repo and updated the placeholder in the manifest.
#     Needs the URL of the repo and the branch to find the latest commit from, in this line format: latestcommit^PLACEHOLDERTEXT^url^branch
# latestghtag: Finds the most recent tag on a GitHub repo, for repos that don't have normal releases, but also shouldn't use the latest commit
#     Needs the URL of the repo, in this line format: latestghtag^PLACEHOLDERTEXT^url
# latestghrelease: Finds the download URL and SHA256 hash of the latest release from a git repo.
#     Needs the API URL of the repo, in this line format: latestappimage^PLACEHOLDERTEXT^https://api.github.com/repos/<owner-name>/<repo-name>/releases/latest^<file suffix>
#     As this command updates two different placeholders (one for the URL, one for the file hash) in the manifest, 
#     the URL that would be used in the above example is "PLACEHOLDERTEXT" and the hash placeholder text would be "HASHPLACEHOLDERTEXT"
#     The "HASH" prefix of the placeholder text is hardcoded in the script
#     The <file_suffix> will be the file extension or other identifying suffix at the end of the file name that can be used to select from multiple releases.
#     Example: If there are these file options for a given release:
#     yuzu-mainline-20240205-149629642.AppImage
#     yuzu-linux-20240205-149629642-source.tar.xz
#     yuzu-linux-20240205-149629642-debug.tar.xz 
#     Entering "AppImage" (without quotes) for the <file_suffix> will identify yuzu-mainline-20240205-149629642.AppImage
#     Entering "source-.tar.xz" (without quotes) for the <file_suffix> will identify yuzu-linux-20240205-149629642-source.tar.xz
#     Entering "debug-tar.xz" (without quotes) for the <file_suffix> will identify yuzu-linux-20240205-149629642-debug.tar.xz
#     As a file extension like ".tar.zx" can apply to multiple file options, the entire part that is appended to each release name should be included.
#     The <file_suffix> will also only consider entries where the given suffix is at the end of the file name. So "AppImage" will identify "file.AppImage" but not "file.AppImage.zsync"
# outside_file: Prints the contents of a file from the build environment (such as the buildid file) and replaces the placeholder text with those contents.
# outside_env_var: Gets the value of an environmental variable from the build environment (the output of "echo $var" from the terminal) and replaces the placeholder text with that value.
# custom_command: Runs a single command explicitly as written in the $URL field of the task list, including variable and command expansion. This should work the same as if you were runnig the command directly from the terminal.
#     This command does not need a PLACEHOLDERTEXT field in the task list, so needs to be in this syntax: custom_command^^$COMMAND
# url: This is used to calculate a dynamic URL and the value to the $caluculated_url environmental variable, for use in other subsequent commands.

Instead of having several different emulators, engines and frontends on your Linux/SteamOS system you only need one: RetroDECK.

For more information read up here:

[Supported Systems](https://retrodeck.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wiki_general/supported-devices/)

## What is RetroDECK?
RetroDECK is an [ES-DE](https://es-de.org) powered Linux [Flatpak application](https://flathub.org/apps/net.retrodeck.retrodeck) that thanks to its `RetroDECK Framework` it builds-in and manage a variety of emulators and other software that allows you to play your favorite retro (and even not-so-retro) games in one complete package.

### So what does that mean?
It means that RetroDECK provides all the emulators, systems and a frontend. RetroDECK configures them for you and puts them into one application you can download from Flathub.

By being one application RetroDECK can put all important files in one location for all the emulators, instead of having them spread out over your entire system and even add features on top to orchestrate them seamlessly.


### The RetroDECK Framework
As previously mentioned, RetroDECK also adds the `RetroDECK Framework` on top of the emulators and ES-DE interface which allows deeper integrations between emulators and easier exposure to a variety of features that you otherwise need to set on a per emulator basis to create a uniformity between them.

The `RetroDECK Configurator` is a `Utility` that exposes some parts of the `RetroDECK Framework` to the RetroDECK users.

**What can the RetroDECK Framework and by extent the RetroDECK Configurator do?**

It can help with:

- Sync your favorite games with `Steam`
- Run your games with a simple double click from a Desktop environment thanks to the [RetroENGINE](https://retrodeck.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wiki_system_guides/retroengine/retroengine-guide/)
- Check your `BIOS` files
- Auto installing some free `BIOS`es
- Compressing games
- Easier `Texture Pack` and `Mod` management
- File management
- Tools for troubleshooting (Multi-File Structure Checker, Partial or full reset of functions)
- Install prebuilt Steam Input profiles for devices like the Steam Deck and external controllers
- Easier management of `roms`, `scraped media`, `screenshots`, `saves / states` `gamelists` and more
- Give access to global presets that can be activated to configure things over many emulators in one go like: `RetroAchievements`
`Borders` `Widescreen Mode` `Swaping A/B X/Y for Nintendo Games`

# RetroDECK

**RetroDECK** brings an environment to catalog and play your retro games directly from SteamOS and it's tailored specifically for the **Steam Deck**.

It's inspired by embedded emulation systems like AmberELEC, EmuELEC, CoreELEC, Lakka, and Batocera.

Powered by [EmulationStation Desktop Edition](https://es-de.org), which uses RetroArch and other standalone emulators to allow you to import and play your favorite retro (and even not-so-retro) games in a tidy environment without flooding your Steam library.

## What does it mean to be "tailored for the Steam Deck"?
It means that all the configurations are ready to go and tweaked to get the best graphics and performance on the Deck without having the hassle of choosing, installing and configuring tons of emulators: just put your games in the roms folder, provide your own bioses and start your games.

## Do I have to partition my disk to install it?
No partitioning or formatting is required. RetroDECK (differently from AmberELEC, Batocera and others) comes as a flatpak: just install it as any other application and launch it from your desktop or Steam library. You still retain the ability to return to SteamOS by pressing the Steam button or opening the Quick Access menu while using RetroDECK.

## Is it available on Windows?
No, RetroDECK doesn't support Windows, but the project is fully open source so you can port it if you wish. As an alternative, [Retrobat](http://www.retrobat.ovh/) offers similar functionality (but may not be compatible with RetroDECK's rom paths).

## How can I install it?
Just install it from Discover store.<br/>
However if you want to test the cooker version you can follow the [Installation instructions](https://github.com/XargonWan/RetroDECK/wiki/How-to:-Getting-started) on the Wiki

## Can I help?

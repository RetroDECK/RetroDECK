## What is RetroDECK?
RetroDECK is a [EmulationStation Desktop Edition](https://es-de.org) powered application that builds in a variety of emulators and other software that allows you to play your favorite retro (and even not-so-retro) games in a tidy contained flatpak sandbox environment. It's inspired by embedded emulation systems like AmberELEC, EmuELEC, CoreELEC, Lakka, and Batocera.

## What devices/systems does RetroDECK support: 

### Steam Deck

Supported from the start and RetroDECK is tailored to the Steam Deck during the beta period. The goal is that all the configurations are ready out-of-the-box and optimized towards the Steam Deck.

### Linux Desktop
Technically it is working, but the user experience might not be that great it could contain desktop specific bugs and other issues.
You will also need to manually configure the input to match your desktop and might need to tweak more settings. If you want to try it make sure that your distribution has flatpak support (else you will need to install it).<br>
We will start to have a bigger desktop focus after the beta period is over.

### Other SteamOS or Linux handheld gaming devices with flatpak support
We do plan to support other SteamOS based devices in the future. But during the BETA we are focusing on the Steam Deck.<br/> 
You can get it to run on other Linux based devices it is not just as seamless as we want it to be and does not live up to our higher standards.<br/> 
You will need to manually configure the input to match your device and might need to tweak more settings if you try it on a none Steam Deck device. There might also be some hardware specific bugs. 


## Do you have any plans for other systems? 
RetroDECK does not have plans to support Windows, macOS, Android, or iOS.<br>For similar functionality on Windows you could explore [Retrobat](https://www.retrobat.org/) as an alternative.

# Short FAQ

Please read the [Wiki](https://github.com/XargonWan/RetroDECK/wiki) for even more information.

## Do I have to partition or format my disk/sdcard to install it?
No, partitioning or formatting is not needed at all. RetroDECK (differently from AmberELEC, Batocera and others) comes as a flatpak. Just install it as any other application and launch it from your desktop and/or Steam library.
